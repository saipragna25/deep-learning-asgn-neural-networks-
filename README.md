 a) Write  a colab  numpy only from scratch 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression . Use proper non linear activation functions and proper number of hidden layer neurons - show the results / loss and epochs training and final output . You will be doing manual backprop and chain rule based gradient propagation 



b) Write a colab pytorch from scratch - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression withotu using pytorch builtin layer functionality 


 
c) Write  a colab pytorch classes based - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression using pytorch builtin functionality of modules etc.,. backprop etc.,.


d) Write  a colab  pytorch lightening version of the same



e) Build the same using Tensorflow various variants low level, api, functional, model, builtin 



Write  a colab  tensorflow only from scratch not using high level api  of the same



Write a colab tensorflow only with builtin layers of the same



 Write a colab with Use functional api high level api  of tensorflow for the same



Write a colab with tensorflow only but using high level api

 

h) repeat the above using JAX.
