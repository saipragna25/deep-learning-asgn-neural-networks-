 a) Write  a colab  numpy only from scratch 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression . Use proper non linear activation functions and proper number of hidden layer neurons - show the results / loss and epochs training and final output . You will be doing manual backprop and chain rule based gradient propagation

e) Build the same using Tensorflow various variants low level, api, functional, model, builtin 




Write  a colab  tensorflow only from scratch not using high level api  of the same



Write a colab tensorflow only with builtin layers of the same



 Write a colab with Use functional api high level api  of tensorflow for the same



Write a colab with tensorflow only but using high level api
